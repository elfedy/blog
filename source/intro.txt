Welcome
This is the first article of my blog. This blog is about my
programming journey.

About Myself
My name is Federico Andrés Rodríguez, and I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
I used to be an Industrial Engineer. At the end of 2015, bored with my job,
I decided to switch to programming and started preparing for it by reading
stuff about Ruby in my free time.
By the beginning of 2016 I had quit my job and started studying programming full time,
reading books and doing some ad honorem freelance work for friends in need for a website.
In August I got a job as a full time Web Developper.
I have fallen in love with programming, as I love solving problems and feel that
this craft is problem solving at its purest form. My dream is to become a
really good programmer and to build amazing stuff.
This is my first attempt to contribute to the programming community.

What I want this blog to be About
I expect this blog to be a living document about a programmer's journey. by reading
this blog you should find insights about programming and witness how a programmer
changes his way of thinking as he sharpens his skills, gains experience and 
becomes wiser.
At first, I guess the articles will be more oriented to learning how to program
but I expect to get into more technical stuff as time goes by and my understanding
of some subjects grows. Topics will be very varied because I tend to get interested
in very diverse subjects.
I am also open to recommendations about topics for writting so
feel free to email me with questions, suggestions or comments in general.
